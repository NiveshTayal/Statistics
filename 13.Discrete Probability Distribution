Discrete Data:-
Data that can only take certain values i.e cannot be in decimals.
For example: the number of students in a class (you can't have half a student) means u can't say like we have 1.5 students.

Discrete Probability Distribution:-
1) Discrete probability functions are also known as probability mass functions.
2) In Discrete Probability Distribution, the probabilities for all possible values must sum to one.
3) For discrete probability distribution functions, each possible value has a non-zero likelihood/outcomes.

Example:- The likelihood of rolling a specific number on a die is 1/6. 
          The total probability for all six values equals one. When you roll a die, you inevitably obtain one of the possible values.
          i.e when rolling a dice we get either {1,2,3,4,5,6}
          Value   Probability
            1        1/6
            2        1/6
            3        1/6
            4        1/6
            5        1/6
            6      + 1/6
              Total:- 1
              
Types of Discrete Distribution:-
1) Binomial distribution to model binary data, such as coin tosses.
2) Poisson distribution to model count data, such as the count of library book checkouts per hour.

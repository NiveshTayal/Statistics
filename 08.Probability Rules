Union:-
The union of two sets is a new set that contains all of the elements that are in at least one of the two sets. 
The union is written as A∪B or “A or B”.

Intersection:-
The intersection of two sets is a new set that contains all of the elements that are in both sets. 
The intersection is written as A∩B or “A and B”.

Example:-
S={1,2,3,4,5,6}
A={1,3,5}
B={1,2}
A∪B= {1,2,3,5}
A∩B= {1}

Addition Rules for Probability:-
To find the probability of event A or B, we must first determine whether the events are mutually exclusive or non-mutually exclusive. 
Then we can apply the appropriate Addition Rule:

Addition Rule 1: When two events, A and B, are mutually exclusive, the probability that A or B will occur is the sum of the probability 
                 of each event. 
                                               P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

Addition Rule 2: When two events, A and B, are non-mutually exclusive, there is some overlap between these events. 
The probability that A or B will occur is the sum of the probability of each event, minus the probability of the overlap.
                                           P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
                                           
Example:-In a math class of 30 students, 17 are boys and 13 are girls. On a unit test, 4 boys and 5 girls made an A grade.
         If a student is chosen at random from the class, what is the probability of choosing a girl or an A student?
Probabilities: P(girl or A) = P(girl) + P(A) - P(girl and A)
                            = 13/30	  + 9/30 - 	 5/30
                            = 17/30

Multiplication Rules for Probability:- 
Multiplication Rule 1: If A and B are two independent events in a probability experiment, then the probability that both events
                       occur simultaneously is:
                                               P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B)

Multiplication Rule 2: In case of dependent events , the probability that both events occur simultaneously is:
                                             P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B | A)
Note:- The notation P(B | A) means "the probability of B , given that A has happened.

Example:-Suppose you take out two cards from a standard pack of cards one after another, without replacing the first card. 
         What is probability that the first card is the ace of spades, and the second card is a heart?
Solution:- The two events are dependent events because the first card is not replaced.
           There is only one ace of spades in a deck of 52 cards. So:
           P(1st card is the ace of spades)=1/52
           If the ace of spaces is drawn first, then there are 51 cards left in the deck, of which 13 are hearts:
           P(2nd card is a heart | 1st cardis the ace of spades)=13/51
           So, by the multiplication rule of probability, we have:
           P(ace of spades, then a heart)=1/52⋅13/51=/13/4 ⋅ 13 ⋅ 51= 1/204

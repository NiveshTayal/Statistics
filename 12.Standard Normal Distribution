Standard Normal Distribution:-
1) Standard Normal Distribution is also known as the Z-distribution.
2) The standard normal distribution is a special case of the normal distribution where the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1.
3) A value on the standard normal distribution is known as a standard score or a Z-score.

Standardization: How to Calculate Z-scores:-
To standardize your data, you need to convert the raw measurements into Z-scores.
To calculate the standard score for an observation, take the raw measurement, subtract the mean, and divide by the standard deviation. 
Mathematically, the formula for that process is the following:
                                    Z = (X - μ) / σ
X represents the raw value of the measurement of interest. 
Mu and sigma represent the parameters for the population from which the observation was drawn.

After you standardize your data, you can place them within the standard normal distribution. In this manner,
standardization allows you to compare different types of observations based on where each observation falls within its own distribution.

Data standardization:-
Data standardization is this process of making sure that your data set can be compared to other data sets.
Data standardization is about making sure that data is internally consistent; that is, each data type has the same content and format.
Standardized values are useful for tracking data that isn’t easy to compare otherwise.

For example, 
Suppose you and your friend went to different universities. One day, you both got your midterm grades for your Physics 101 classes. 
Your professor sticks to the normal grading scale (out of 100), so you got a grade of 84; the test has a mean of 77 and 
a standard deviation of 6. Your friend’s professor, though, uses his own grading scale, so she got a grade of 452. 
Her test has a scale of 750, mean of 400, and standard deviation of 100.

Both of you scored above average, but who did better? While the main data points might not be immediately comparable, 
there is a way to standardize and compare the data points. Converting them to percentages shows that you came out ahead, 
with an 84% compared to your friend’s 60%.

Similarly, you can convert the scores to z-scores, which show how you each performed in comparison to your classmates. 
This shows that you got a 1.16, meaning that you scored one standard deviation above average; while your friend got 0.52, 
meaning that she only scored half of a standard deviation above average.

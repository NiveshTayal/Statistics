Descriptive statistics helps you understand the data you are dealing with by making numerical and/or graphical summaries and help us gain
insight about how the values are distributed, shape of data, is the data set skewed etc. 
In descriptive stats, we present the facts about the data and do not make conclusions beyond the data we have analysed or reach 
conclusions regarding any hypotheses we might have made.

Some examples are -

Measures of Central Tendency - they describe the central position of a frequency distribution for the data.

Mean - The average value of the data. Use when the data is fairly symmetric, shows just the one trend and is of type Interval or Ratio.
                                              μ=Σ(x1+x2+...xn)/n
Median - The middle value of the data that has been arranged in order of magnitude. Use when the variable type is Ordinal, 
         skewed Interval or Ratio.
Mode - The most frequent value in the data set. Use when working with categorical data and when data shows two or more clusters of data.


Measures of dispersion - they help summarize how spread out the data is by identifying range and variation in the dataset.

Range - It only describes the width of the data by subtracting the lowest data point from the highest data point. 
        It is sensitive to outliers so it can be misleading.
Quartiles - They split your data into quarters- [Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4]. We find Inter-quartile range by Q3 - Q1, which is useful to measure 
            spread of the data and less sensitive to outliers than range as it uses 50% of the central data.
Percentiles - They split your data into percentages in the same way that quartiles split data into quarters. 
              Useful for benchmarking and determining rank or position. They enable you to determine how high a particular value is 
              relative to all the others.
Variance - The variance is the average of the distance of values from the mean squared. 
                             σ2=Σ(x−μ)2n
Standard deviation - It is the square root of variance. It describes how far typical values are from the mean. 
                             σ=√σ2

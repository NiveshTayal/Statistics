Continuous Data:-
Continuous Data can take any value (within a range) means contains decimal value also.
Examples:- 1) We know that probability lies between 0 to 1 so that means any point between 0 to 1 i.e. 0.1,0.2,0.3 and so on.
           2) A person's height: could be any value (within the range of human heights), not just certain fixed heights

Continuous Probability Distributions:-
1) Continuous probability functions are also known as probability density functions.
2) Continuous distribution will apply if the variable can assume an infinite number of values between any two values(Continous Data).
3) Continuous distributions have a zero or lower probability. 
   For example, the likelihood of measuring a temperature that is exactly 32 degrees is zero.
4) Probabilities for continuous distributions are measured over ranges of values rather than single points.
5) The proportion of the area under the curve that falls within a range of values along the X-axis represents the likelihood that a 
   value will fall within that range. 

Type of Continuous Probability Distributions:-
1) Normal distribution, which is also known as the Gaussian distribution or the “bell curve.”

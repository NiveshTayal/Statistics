Binomial distribution:-
1) The binomial is a type of distribution that has two possible outcomes (the prefix “bi” means two, or twice).
2) A binomial distribution can be thought of as simply the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE outcome in an experiment or
   survey that is repeated multiple times. 
 
For example, a coin toss has only two possible outcomes: heads or tails and 
             taking a test could have two possible outcomes: 
             1)If you choose head and while tossing head came: pass
             2)If you choose head and while tossing tail came: fail.

Criteria for Binomial Distribution:-
1) The experiment consists of n fixed trials. In simple words, Experiment :-Tossing the coin 10 times so n=10
2) Each trial can result in just two possible outcomes. We call one of these outcomes a success and the other, a failure.
   So, Tossing a coin will result in two outcome only i.e Head or Tail.
3) The probability of success, denoted by P, is the same on every trial.
   In simple word, when you toss the coin 1st time and head came up so Probability= 1/2
                   Tossing the coin 2nd time and tail comes up so Probability =1/2
                   Again for 3rd toss, head comes up so Probability=1/2 
            So, as you see for every trail, Probability is will remain same.
 4) The trials are independent; that is, the outcome on one trial does not affect the outcome on other trials.
    In simple words, getting heads on one trial does not affect whether we get heads on other trials.

Binomial Distribution formula:-
The binomial distribution formula is:
                              b(x; n, P) = nCx * P^x * (1 – P)^n – x
Where:
nCx = n!/x!(n-x)!
b = binomial probability
x = total number of “successes” (pass or fail, heads or tails etc.)
P = probability of a success on an individual trial
n = number of trials

Binomial Distribution Properties:-
The binomial distribution has the following properties:
The mean of the distribution (μx) is equal to n * P .
The variance (σ2x) is n * P * ( 1 - P ).
The standard deviation (σx) is sqrt[ n * P * ( 1 - P ) ].

Example:-
Suppose a die is tossed 5 times. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 fours?
Solution: This is a binomial experiment in which the number of trials is equal to 5, 
                                    So, n=5
          The number of successes is equal to 2, 
                                    So, x=2
          and the probability of success on a single trial is 1/6 or about 0.167. 
          Therefore, the binomial probability is:
                     b(2; 5, 0.167) = 5C2 * (0.167)^2 * (1-0.167)^(5-2)
                     b(2; 5, 0.167) = 0.161

Normal Distribution:-
1) Normal Distribution is also known as the Gaussian distribution and the bell curve.
2) The normal distribution is a probability function that describes how the values of a variable are distributed.
3) Theyâ€™re all symmetric about the center. The normal distribution cannot model skewed distributions.
4) The mean, median, and mode are all equal.
5) Half of the population is less than the mean and half is greater than the mean.

Parameters of the Normal Distribution:-
The parameters for the normal distribution define its shape and probabilities entirely.
The normal distribution has two parameters:
1) Mean:-
   Mean defines the location of the peak for normal distributions. 
   Most values cluster around the mean. On a graph, changing the mean shifts the entire curve left or right on the X-axis.
 
2) Standard Deviation:-
   Standard Deviation defines the width of the normal distribution. 
   The standard deviation determines how far away from the mean the values tend to fall. 
   It represents the typical distance between the observations and the average.
   On a graph, changing the standard deviation either tightens or spreads out the width of the distribution along the X-axis. 
   Larger standard deviations produce distributions that are more spread out.

Poisson distribution:-
A Poisson distribution is a measure of how many times an event is likely to occur within "X" period of time.
In simple words, Everyday i study for 4 hours daily so with the help of Poisson distribution we can find what is the probability that i 
can study for 6 hours on particular day.

Example: A video store averages 400 customers every Friday night. 
         What is the probability that 600 customers will come in on any given Friday night?

Criteria for Poisson distribution:-
1) The experiment results in outcomes that can be classified as successes or failures.
2) The average number of successes (μ) that occurs in a specified region is known. i.e mean is known.
3) Outcomes are random. Occurance of one outcome does not affect the outcome of the other.
4) Outcomes are rare compared to possible outcomes.

Formula for Poisson Distribution:-
                                P(x; μ) = (e^-μ)*(μ^x)/x!
Where,
e: A constant equal to approximately 2.71828. (Actually, e is the base of the natural logarithm system.)
μ: The mean number of successes that occur in a specified region.
x: The actual number of successes that occur in a specified region.
P(x; μ): The Poisson probability that exactly x successes occur in a Poisson experiment, when the mean number of successes is μ.

Properties of Poisson Distribution:-
1) The mean of the distribution is equal to μ .
2) The variance is also equal to μ .

Example:-
The average number of homes sold by the Acme Realty company is 2 homes per day. 
What is the probability that exactly 3 homes will be sold tomorrow?
Solution:-
μ = 2; since 2 homes are sold per day, on average.
x = 3; since we want to find the likelihood that 3 homes will be sold tomorrow.
e = 2.71828; since e is a constant equal to approximately 2.71828.
We plug these values into the Poisson formula as follows:
                                     P(x; μ) = (e^-μ)*(μ^x)/x!
                                     P(3; 2) = (2.71828^-2) (2^3) / 3!
                                     P(3; 2) = (0.13534) (8) / 6
                                     P(3; 2) = 0.180
Thus, the probability of selling 3 homes tomorrow is 0.180 .

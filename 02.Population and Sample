Population:-Population in statistics is about the whole or total of the defined group or number of participants etc. that we are trying to 
collect information for data driven discussions.

Sample:-A subset of a population is sample in statistics.

Quick example.
Suppose you're preparing a soup, at some point you'd want to know if there's enough salt in it right?
To check that, you wouldn't take the entire soup, rather you'll take a fraction from it, and use that fraction to deduce if there's 
enough salt in the soup.
Thereby making an inference on the entire population from a sample.

Range
A range is the most common and easily understandable measure of dispersion. 
It is the difference between two extreme observations of the data set. If X max and X min are the two extreme observations then
                                            Range = X max – X min

Advantages
1) It is the simplest of the measure of dispersion
2) Easy to calculate
3) Easy to understand
4) Independent of change of origin

Disadvantages
1) It is based on two extreme observations. Hence, get affected by fluctuations
2) A range is not a reliable measure of dispersion
3) Dependent on change of scale

Example:-Dataset:-4, 6, 9, 3, 7
         the lowest value is 3, and the highest is 9. 
         So the range is 9 − 3 = 6.
         
Quartile Deviation
The quartiles divide a data set into quarters. 
The first quartile, (Q1) is the middle number between the smallest number and the median of the data. 
The second quartile, (Q2) is the median of the data set. 
The third quartile, (Q3) is the middle number between the median and the largest number.

Quartile deviation or semi-inter-quartile deviation is
                                                Q = (Q3 – Q1)/2

Advantages
1) All the drawbacks of Range are overcome by quartile deviation
2) It uses half of the data
3) Independent of change of origin
4) The best measure of dispersion for open-end classification

Disadvantages
1) It ignores 50% of the data
2) Dependent on change of scale
3) Not a reliable measure of dispersion

Example:-Dataset:-7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 22
         n=9
         Q1 = (9 + 1)/4 => 10/4 => 2.5 Term
         Q3 = (9 + 1)*3/4 => (10)*3/4 => 7.5 Term
Calculation of quartile deviation can be done as follows,
Q1 is an average of 2nd which is11 and adds the product of the difference between 3rd & 4th and 0.5 which is (12-11)*0.5 = 11.50.
Q3 is 7th term and product of 0.5 and the difference between 8th and 7th term which is (18-16)*0.5 and the result is  16 + 1 = 17.
Q.D. = (Q3 – Q1) / 2 => (17-11.50) / 2 => 5.5/2
Q.D.=2.75

Standard Deviation
A standard deviation is the positive square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations of the given values from
their arithmetic mean. It is denoted by a Greek letter sigma, σ. It is also referred to as root mean square deviation. 
The standard deviation is given as
                                  square root of [ (1/N) * Sigma(xi - mean)^2 ]
                                                          i=1 to N
 
Advantages
1) Squaring the deviations overcomes the drawback of ignoring signs in mean deviations
2) Suitable for further mathematical treatment
3) Least affected by the fluctuation of the observations
4) The standard deviation is zero if all the observations are constant
5) Independent of change of origin

Disadvantages
1) Not easy to calculate
2) Difficult to understand for a layman
3) Dependent on the change of scale

Variance
The square of the standard deviation is the variance. It is also a measure of dispersion.
                                     Variance= (standard deviation)^2

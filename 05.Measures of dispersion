Measures of dispersion:-The measure of dispersion shows the scatterings of the data. 
                        It tells the variation of the data from one another and gives a clear idea about the distribution of the data. 
                        The measure of dispersion shows the homogeneity or the heterogeneity of the distribution of the observations.
                        
Characteristics of Measures of Dispersion
1) A measure of dispersion should be rigidly defined
2) It must be easy to calculate and understand
3) Not affected much by the fluctuations of observations
4) Based on all observations        

Classification of Measures of Dispersion
1) The measures which express the scattering of observation in terms of distances i.e., range, quartile, percentile.
2) The measure which expresses the variations in terms of the average of deviations of observations like variance and 
   standard deviation.

Probability Distribution:-
A probability distribution is a list of all of the possible outcomes of a random variable along with their corresponding probability values.
To give a concrete example, here is the probability distribution of a fair 6-sided die.
                           Outcome of Random Variable	 1	 2	 3	 4	 5	 6
                                          Probability	1/6	1/6	1/6	1/6	1/6	1/6

In simple words:-You have a dataset having data of 10 users, now imagine one column from your dataset i.e height(random variable).
So we have 10 heights(possible outcome) of 10 users.
So probability distribution provide us the propability of each height(possible outcome) of each users.
Probability distribution is represented by graph.

Probability distributions describe the dispersion of the values of a random variable. 
Consequently, the kind of variable determines the type of probability distribution. 
For a single random variable, statisticians divide distributions into the following two types:

1) Discrete probability distributions for discrete variables
2) Probability density functions for continuous variables

One-Sample z-Test:-
A one-sample z-test is used to test whether a population parameter is significantly different from some hypothesized value.
The one-sample z-test is used to test whether the mean of a population is greater than, less than, or not equal to a
specific value. Because the standard normal distribution is used to calculate critical values for the test, this test is
often called the one-sample z-test.

One-Sample Z-Test Assumptions(When to use z-Test):-
1) The data are continuous (not discrete).
2) The data follow the normal probability distribution.
3) The sample is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal
   probability of being selected in the sample.
4) The population standard deviation is known.

Formula for z-Test:-
                                            z = (x - Δ) / [ σ /sqrt(n) ]  
Where,
x is the sample mean
Δ is a specified value to be tested
σ is the population standard deviation
n is the size of the sample. 
Look up the significance level of the z‐value in the standard normal table

Example:-
Question:-In national use, a vocabulary test is known to have a mean score of 68 and a standard deviation of 13. 
          A class of 19 students takes the test and has a mean score of 65.
          Is the class typical of others who have taken the test? Assume a significance level of p < 0.05?
Solution:-
Step 1:-Define hypotheses:- The table below shows three sets of null and alternative hypotheses. 
        Each makes a statement about how the true population mean μ is related to some hypothesized value M.
        Set	 Null hypothesis	Alternative hypothesis	Number of tails
         1	    μ = M	           μ ≠ M                   2
         2	    μ >= M	         μ < M	                 1
         3	    μ <= M	         μ > M	                 1
         In this example:-
         null hypothesis: H0: μ = 68
         alternative hypothesis: Ha : μ ≠ 68
         
Step 2:-Specify significance level:- Often, researchers choose significance levels equal to 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10.
        Confidence Level	     Significance Level      Critical Value (Z-score)
              0.90	              1-0.90=0.10                   1.645
              0.91	                  0.09                      1.70
              0.92	                  0.08                      1.75
              0.93	                  0.07                      1.81
              0.94	                  0.06                      1.88
              0.95	                  0.05                      1.96
              0.96	                  0.04                      2.05
              0.97	                  0.03                      2.17
              0.98	                  0.02                      2.33
              0.99	                  0.01                      2.575
        In this example:-
        significance level: 0.05
        Critical Value (Z-score): 1.96

Step 3:-Compute test statistic:- The test statistic is a z-score (z) defined by the following equation.
                             z = (x - Δ)/[ σ /sqrt(n) ]
        In this example:- 
                             z = (65 - 68)/[13/sqrt(19)] => -1.006
        Note:- We get a z-score of negative 1.006. Because this is a two-sided test, it is not enough to just look at the left tail.
               We also have to look at the equivalent of the right tail, or a positive 1.006.
               
Step 4:- Compute P-value:- The P-value is the probability of observing a sample statistic as extreme as the test statistic.
         Since the test statistic is a z-score, use the z-table to assess the probability associated with the z-score.
         The first way to find the p-value is to use the z-table. In the z-table, the left column will show values to the tenths place,
         while the top row will show values to the hundredths place. 
         In this example:-
         If we have a z-score of -1.006, we need to round this to the hundredths place, or -1.0. 
         In the left column, we will first find the tenths place, or -1.0. In the top row, we will find the hundredths place, or 0.
         This results in a p-value of 0.1587, or 15.87%, for a z-score of negative 1.006. 
         We also need to take the positive 1.006 into account, which is the upper right tail.
         To calculate the true p-value, we just need to multiply 0.1587 by two, or 0.3174. 
         This would be a p-value of 31.74%.
         
Step 5:- Evaluate null hypothesis:- The evaluation involves comparing the P-value to the significance level, and rejecting the 
         null hypothesis when the P-value is less than the significance level.
         In this example:-
         Because –1.006 is between –1.96 and 1.96, the null hypothesis of population mean is 68 and cannot be rejected. 
         That is, there is not evidence that this class can be considered different from others who have taken the test.

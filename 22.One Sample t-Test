One Sample t-Test:-
The one sample t test compares the mean of your sample data to a known value. 
For example, you might want to know how your sample mean compares to the population mean. 
You should run a one sample t test when you don’t know the population standard deviation or you have a small sample size.

One-Sample t-Test Assumptions(When to use t-Test):-
1) The data are continuous (not discrete).
2) The data follow the normal probability distribution.
3) The sample is a simple random sample from its population. Each individual in the population has an equal
   probability of being selected in the sample.
4) The population standard deviation is not known.
5) The sample size is smaller i.e less than 30. 

Formula for t-Test:-
                                            t = (x - Δ) / [ σ /sqrt(n) ]  
Where,
x is the sample mean
Δ is a specified value to be tested
σ is the sample standard deviation
n is the size of the sample. 

Example:-
Question:-Your company wants to improve sales. Past sales data indicate that the average sale was $100 per transaction. 
          After training your sales force, recent sales data (taken from a sample of 25 salesmen) indicates an average sale of $130,
          with a standard deviation of $15. Did the training work? Test your hypothesis at a 5% alpha level.
Solution:-
Step 1:-Define hypotheses:- The table below shows three sets of null and alternative hypotheses. 
        Each makes a statement about how the true population mean μ is related to some hypothesized value M.
        Set	 Null hypothesis	Alternative hypothesis	Number of tails
         1	    μ = M	           μ ≠ M                   2
         2	    μ >= M	         μ < M	                 1
         3	    μ <= M	         μ > M	                 1
         In this example:-
         null hypothesis: H0:  μ = $100
         alternative hypothesis: Ha :  μ > $100
         
Step 2:-Specify significance level:- Often, researchers choose significance levels equal to 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10.
        In this example:-
        significance level: 0.05

Step 3:-Find degrees of freedom:- The degrees of freedom (DF) is:
                                         DF = n - 1
         where n is the number of observations in the sample.
         In this example:-
                                      DF = 25-1 => 24
                                      
Step 4:-Compute test statistic:- The test statistic is a t-score (t) defined by the following equation.
                             t = (x - Δ)/[ σ /sqrt(n) ]
        In this example:- 
                             t = (130 – 100) / ((15 / √(25)) => 10
               
Step 4:-Calculate t-critical value:- You need two values to find this:
        1) The alpha level
        2) The degrees of freedom
        In this example:- 
        Look up 24 degrees of freedom in the left column and 0.05 in the top row. 
        The intersection is 1.711.This is your one-tailed critical t-value.
        Note:- What this critical value means is that we would expect most values to fall under 1.711. 
        If our calculated t-value (from Step 3) falls within this range, the null hypothesis is likely true.
         
Step 5:- Evaluate null hypothesis:- If our calculated t-value (from Step 3) falls within t-critical (from Step 4), 
         the null hypothesis is likely true.
         In this example:- 
         The t-value i.e 10 does not fall into the range i.e t-critical (1.711), so we can reject the null hypothesis. 
         The value of 10 falls into the rejection region (the left tail).
         
In other words, it’s highly likely that the mean sale is greater. The sales training was probably a success.

When to use Paired T-Test:-
1) When two Populations are dependent on each other.
2) Where you have two samples in which observations in one sample can be paired with observations in the other sample. 
3) If the values in one sample affect the values in the other sample, (the samples are dependent.)
Example: Blood pressure before and after a specific medicine.

Paired T-Test:-
Paired T-Test is used to determine whether the mean of a dependent variable (e.g., weight, anxiety level, salary, reaction time, etc.) 
is the same in two related groups (e.g., two groups of participants that are measured at two different "time points" or who undergo 
two different "conditions").

Formula for Paired T-Test:-
                                              t= d/sqrt((s)²/n)
Where,
d = the mean of differences
s = the standard deviation of differences
n = sample size

Steps for Paired T-Test:-
Step 1:- Find the difference between two set of readings as d1, d2 …. dn.
Step 2:- Find the mean and standard deviation of these differences.
Step 3:- Apply formula and find test statistics.
Step 4:- Find degree of freedom as df= n-1 (n=Smaple size).
Step 5:- Find Significance level (already given in question).
Step 6:- Find t-critical value from t table with the help of alpha nd df.
Step 7:- Compare your calculated value (Step 3) to your table value (Step 6).

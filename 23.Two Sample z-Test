Two Sample z-Test:-
1) A Two sample z-test is a statistical test to determine whether two population means are different when the variances are known and 
   the sample size is large.
2) It can be used to test hypotheses in which the z-test follows a normal distribution.
3) Two sample z-test check if the difference between the average (mean) of two groups (populations) is significant, using sample data.

Two-Sample Z-Test Assumptions(When to use z-Test):-
1) The data follow the normal probability distribution.
2) The standard deviations of both populations are known.
3) Expected difference d between the populations's average is known.

Formula for Two-Sample Z-Test:-
                                   z = (x1 - x2 -Δ) / sqrt((σ1)²/n1 + (σ2)²/n2)
Where,
x1 and x2 are the means of the two samples
Δ is the hypothesized difference between the population means (0 if testing for equal means)
σ1 and σ2 are the standard deviations of the two populations
n1 and n2 are the sizes of the two samples.

Example:-
Question:-The amount of a certain trace element in blood is known to vary with a standard deviation of 14.1 ppm (parts per million) 
          for male blood donors and 9.5 ppm for female donors. Random samples of 75 male and 50 female donors yield concentration means 
          of 28 and 33 ppm, respectively. What is the likelihood that the population means of concentrations of the element are the 
          same for men and women?
Solution:-
Step 1:-Define hypotheses:-
                 Null hypothesis: H0 : μ1 = μ2
                               or H0 : μ1 – μ2= 0
                 Alternative hypothesis : Ha : μ1 ≠ μ2

Step 2:-Specify significance level:-Often, researchers choose significance levels equal to 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10.

Step 3:-Compute test statistic:- The test statistic is a z-score (z) defined by the following equation.
                                   z = (x1 - x2 -Δ) / sqrt((σ1)²/n1 + (σ2)²/n2)
        In this example:- 
                                   z= (28-33-0)/sqrt((14.1)²/75 + (9.5)²/50) => -2.37
                                   
Step 4:- Find z-Critical value:- With the help of significance level and type of tail test i.e (left, right or both), you can find
                                 z-critical value.
                                 
Step 5:- Evaluate null hypothesis:- The evaluation involves comparing the test statistic(from step 3) to the z-Critical value(from step 4)
                                    , and rejecting the null hypothesis when test statistic lies outside the range of z-Critical value.

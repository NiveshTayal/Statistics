Two Sample Variance Test- F Test:-
1) F-test is used for testing equality of two variances from different populations.
2) The populations from which the two samples are drawn are approximately normally distributed.
3) The two populations are independent of each other.

Two Sample Variance Test- F Test Assumptions:-
1) The larger variance should always go in the numerator (the top number) to force the test into a right-tailed test. 
   Right-tailed tests are easier to calculate.
2) For two-tailed tests, divide alpha by 2 before finding the right critical value.
3) If you are given standard deviations, they must be squared to get the variances.

Formula for F-Test:-
                                           F = (s1)² / (s2)²
Where,
s1 and s2= variances of two populations
 
Steps to compare two variances by F-Test:-
Step 1: Write your hypothesis statements:
        Ho: No difference in variances.
        Ha: Difference in variances.
        
Step 2: Calculate your F critical value. Put the highest variance as the numerator and the lowest variance as the denominator:
                F Statistic = variance 1/ variance 2
 
Step 3: Calculate the degrees of freedom:
        The degrees of freedom in the table will be the sample size -1, so:
        df1= sample size-1 (here sample size is for that population whose variance is larger) 
        df2= sample size-1 (here sample size is for that population whose variance is smaller) 

Step 4: Choose an alpha level:- If No alpha was stated in the question, so use 0.05 (the standard “go to” in statistics).
                                This needs to be halved for the two-tailed test, so use 0.025.
                                
Step 5: Find the critical F Value using the F Table:-
        There are several tables, so make sure you look in the alpha = .025 table. 
        Critical F (df1,df2) at alpha (0.025)

Step 6: Compare your calculated value (Step 2) to your table value (Step 5):-
        If your calculated value is higher than the table value, you can reject the null hypothesis as accept that.

Probability:-
Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with the calculation that events happen and ranges from 0 (impossible) to 
1 (absolute certainty).
If something is known to be true, it has a probability of 1.
If something is known to be false, it has a probability of 0.

Probability of Occurrence of an Event:-
The probability of occurrence of an event is defined as:
             P(occurrence of an event) = Number of trials in which event occurred
                                               Total number of trials 
Example:-1. A dice is thrown 65 times and 4 appeared 2 1 times. Now, in a random throw of a dice, what is the probability of getting a 4?
Solution:
Total number of tria1s = 65.
Number of times 4 appeared = 21.
Probability of getting a 4 = Number of times 4 appeared/Total number of trials
                           = 21/65

Experiment:-
An operation which can produce some well-defined outcomes is called an experiment.

Sample Space:-
The entire possible set of outcomes of a random experiment is the sample space.
The sample space for the tossing of three coins simultaneously is given by:
S = {(T , T , T) , (T , T , H) , (T , H , T) , (T , H , H ) , (H , T , T ) , (H , T , H) , (H , H, T) ,(H , H , H)}

Events/Outcome:-
Any event consisting of a single point of the sample space is known as an event in probability.
For example, if S = {56 , 78 , 96 , 54 , 89} and E = {78} then E is an event.

Trial:-
By a trial, we mean performing a random experiment.
For example, throwing a die or tossing a coin etc.

Types Of Events:-
1)Independent Events:- If the occurrence of any event is completely unaffected by the occurrence of any other event, such events are 
                       known as an independent event in probability.
                                 P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B)
Example:
A box contains 4 red marbles and 3 green marbles.One marble is removed from the box and then replaced.Another marble is drawn from the 
box.  What is the probability that the first marble is red and the second marble is green?
Note:-Because the first marble is replaced, the size of the sample space ( 7 ) does not change from the first drawing to the second so 
the events are independent.
                                      P(red then green)=P(blue)⋅P(green) = (4/7)*(3/7) = 12/49
                                      
2)Mutually Exclusive Events:- If the occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of another event, such events are mutually 
                              exclusive events i.e. two events don’t have any common point. 
For example, if S = {1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6} and E1, E2 are two events such that 
E1 consists of numbers less than 3 and E2 consists of numbers greater than 4.
So, E1 = {1,2} and E2 = {5,6} .
Then, E1 and E2 are mutually exclusive.

3)Complementary Events:- For any event E1 there exists another event E1‘ which represents the remaining elements of the sample space S.
                                                      E1 = S − E1‘
Example:-If a dice is rolled then the sample space S is given as S = {1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 }. 
         If event E1 represents all the outcomes which is greater than 4, then E1 = {5,6} and E1‘ = {1,2,3,4}.
Thus E1‘ is the complement of the event E1.

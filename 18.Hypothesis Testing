Hypothesis Testing:-
Hypothesis testing  is a procedure in inferential statistics that assesses two mutually exclusive theories about the properties of a 
population. For a generic hypothesis test, the two hypotheses are as follows:
    1) Null hypothesis: There is no effect
    2) Alternative hypothesis: There is an effect.

The sample data must provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the effect exists in the population. 
Ideally, a hypothesis test fails to reject the null hypothesis when the effect is not present in the population, 
and it rejects the null hypothesis when the effect exists.

Hypothesis tests use sample data to make inferences about the properties of a population. 

Null hypothesis:-
1) The null hypothesis is often displayed as H0.
2) The null hypothesis is one of two mutually exclusive hypotheses in a hypothesis test.
3) Typically, the null hypothesis states that the true effect size equals zeroâ€”that there is no difference between the groups.
   Here group means population and sample.
 
Alternative hypothesis:-
1) The alternative hypothesis is often denoted as H1 or HA.
2) The alternative hypothesis is one of two mutually exclusive hypotheses in a hypothesis test. 
3) The alternative hypothesis states that the population parameter does not equal the null hypothesis value i.e the test can 
   detect differences both greater than and less than the null value.

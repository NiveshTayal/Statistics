Two Sample t-test:-
1) A Two sample t-test is a statistical test to determine whether there is a difference between two groups within the population.
2) Population variances are not usually known. 
3) The approach we use instead is to pool sample variances and use the t distribution.
4) If the values in one sample reveal no information about those of the other sample, then the samples are independent.
   Example:  Blood pressure of male/female

Cases where the t distribution is used:-
1) Independent Populations
   a) Equal variances
   b) Unequal variances
2) Dependent Populations
   a) Paired samples
   
Formula for t-test:-
Note:- Always perform Two sample variance F test to check whether the variances are Equal or unequal for population.
If Equal variances:-
                     t = (x1 - x2) -Δ) / s*sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2)
         Where,
         x1 and x2 are the means of the two samples
         Δ is the hypothesized difference between the population means (0 if testing for equal means)
         n1 and n2 are the sizes of the two samples.
                      s= (n1-1)(s1)²+(n2-1)(s2)²/(n1+n2-2)
         Where, s1 and s2 are the samples standard deviation.
         Degree of Freedom :- n1+n2-2
         
If UnEqual variances:-
                     t = (x1 - x2) -Δ) / sqrt((s1)²/n1 + (s2)²/n2)
         Where,
         x1 and x2 are the means of the two samples
         Δ is the hypothesized difference between the population means (0 if testing for equal means)
         n1 and n2 are the sizes of the two samples.
         s1 and s2 are the samples standard deviation.
         Degree of Freedom :- ((s1)²/n1 + (s2)²/n2)²/(((s1)²/n1)²/(n1-1)+((s2)²/n2)²/(n2-1))

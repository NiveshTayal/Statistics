Inferential Statistics:-
Inferential statistics takes data from a sample and makes inferences about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. 
Because the goal of inferential statistics is to draw conclusions from a sample and generalize them to a population, 
we need to have confidence that our sample accurately reflects the population.

There are two main areas of inferential statistics:
1) Estimating parameters -> This means taking a statistic from your sample data (for example the sample mean) and using it to say 
   something about a population parameter (i.e. the population mean).
2) Hypothesis tests -> This is where you can use sample data to answer research questions. 
   For example, you might be interested in knowing if a new cancer drug is effective.

Type of Test in Inferential Statistics:-
1) One Sample test -> In this test you take one sample out of population and will check whether that sample mean is different from 
   Population mean. One Sample test includes:-
   a) One sample z test
   b) One sample t test

2) Two sample test -> You perform this test when you want to compare sample mean of two different population. Two sample test includes:-
   a) Two sample z test
   b) Two sample t test
   c) Paired t test
   d) Two sample standard deviation

3) More than 2 sample :- When you have more than 2 samples from different populations. This includes:-
   a) ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

Chi Square- Goodness of Fit Test:-
1) Goodness of Fit Test tells you if your sample data represents the data you would expect to find in the actual population.
2) The goodness of fit test is a statistical hypothesis test to see how well sample data fit a distribution from a population 
   with a normal distribution.
3) This test shows if your sample data represents the data you would expect to find in the actual population or if it is somehow skewed.
4) Chi Square Goodness of Fit can be used for any time of data: Continuous or Discrete.


Formula for Chi Square Test:-
                                           X²=(O-E)²/E
Where, 
X²= Chi-Square goodness of fit test 
O= observed value 
E= expected value

Example:-
Question:-A coin is flipped 100 times. Number of heads are noted. Is this coin biased?
                         Expected   Observed 
                             50         51 
                             50         52 
                             50         56 
                             50         82 
                             50         65
Solution:-
Step 1:-Define hypotheses:- 
        H0: The data follow a specified distribution. 
        Ha: The data do not follow the specified distribution. 

Step 2:-Compute test statistic:- The test statistic is a Chi Square Test defined by the following equation.
                             X²=(O-E)²/E
        In this example:- 
                             X² = 25.8

Step 3:- Compute degrees of freedom and alpha value:- 
                                               df=n-1
         In this example:-
                                               df=5-1=> 4
                                               alpha value= 0.95(given)
Step 4:- Critical Statistic: Chi square for k-1 degrees of freedom for specific alpha with the help of Chi square table.
         In this example:-
                            X²(4,0.95)= 9.49
Step 4:- Evaluate null hypothesis:- The evaluation involves comparing the test statistic(step 2) to the Critical Statistic(step 4).
         In this example:-
         We are rejecting the null hypothesis as test statistic>Critical Statistic.
